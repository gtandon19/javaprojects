OOPProperties:

This folder consists of codes that attempted to encompass the 4 basic Object-Oriented Programming properties:
1. Polymorphism
2. Encapsulation
3. Abstraction

It consists of a few classes with descriptions included of the intended functionality for each, 
along with copies of relevant files required to implement the program.
It also includes a simple FileClass that performs baseline functions like creating a file, and doing basic checks on it.
